# My OpenTelemetry Notes

**Your personal repo.** You are the owner. There is no remote—nothing is shared with anyone.

- **OpenTelemetry-Learning-Handbook.md** — Step-by-step learning guide (Docker, demo, data model, scenarios).
- Add more files and folders as you like. Commit on `main` whenever you want.

## Commands you’ll use

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\hroch\Documents\BannerHealth\oPEN tELEMETRY\my-opentelemetry-notes"

# See status
git status

# Add and commit (you own this repo)
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

Do **not** run `git remote add` or `git push` unless you choose to share this repo later.
